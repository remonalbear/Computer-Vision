# Part 2

## Filter the noisy image using the following low pass filters:
in this section we use function "avgFilter" to manipulate the noisy image with a specific filter we choose and the result is ... 
## - original image

# Part 4

## Draw histogram and distribution curve

In this part we've implemented a function called "df" that takes an image data array and return the histogram values for each intensity value.

Using that values to draw a "BarGraphItem" on pyqtgraph we got the following output...

# Part 9

## Frequency domain filters (high pass and low pass)
in this section we use function "freqFilters" to manipulate the image with a LPS or HPS in the frequency domain and get the pic back and the result is ...
